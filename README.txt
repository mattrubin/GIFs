Take home exercise:

Simple iOS GIF search app.

Description:

* Lets users search for GIFs using Giphy API.
* App has: text input for search, search button & collection view for displaying search results.
* Giphy API docs here: https://developers.giphy.com/. You'll probably only need single endpoint: /v1/gifs/search.  You can use our API key: ZsUpUm2L6cVbvei347EQNp7HrROjbOdc
* One option for rendering GIFs is https://github.com/ibireme/YYImage.  Feel free to use an alternative.

Details

* Gifs don't need to be interactive. Extra Credit: tapping GIF does one of the following: save to camera roll/copy/show sharing option/show fullscreen.
* Only show single page of 100 results. Extra Credit: show more using paging.
* Collection view layout can be simple - single GIF per row, with correct aspect ratio.  Extra Credit: A better layout.
* Scrolling through collection view/GIFs should be smooth.  
* GIFs should appear as they load. Extra credit: unload offscreen GIFs.
* Update search results when when user taps search button. Extra Credit: update search results as user edit search text.
* App layout should adapt to any iOS phone. Extra credit: support landscape & portrait orientations or iPad.

Feel free to use any third party libraries to complete task.
